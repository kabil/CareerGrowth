# Staff Engineer Improvement Tracker (Manager Expectations)

> Use this as a living checklist to align with manager feedback and demonstrate progress.

## Core Expectations (verbatim themes → tracked behaviors)

### 1) **Outcome > Effort**
- **What this means:** Impact on customer & business (revenue, cost, reliability) matters more than hours or learning. citeturn3search1turn3search2
- **My actions:**
  - [ ] Convert tasks to outcome statements with metrics.
  - [ ] Report weekly on customer/business impact moved.

### 2) **Operate in Ambiguity**
- **What this means:** Staff handles unknowns; creates clarity & direction across teams. citeturn3search2
- **My actions:**
  - [ ] Pick one ambiguous, cross‑team problem and own it end‑to‑end.
  - [ ] Publish a one‑pager strategy and alignment plan.

### 3) **Differentiate Beyond AI‑Assisted Execution**
- **What this means:** SEs with AI can execute tasks; Staff must provide higher‑order impact (strategy, systems, leverage). citeturn3search2turn3search5
- **My actions:**
  - [ ] Focus on architecture, risk, and org‑level bottlenecks.
  - [ ] Build reusable assets (frameworks/tooling) that outlast me.

### 4) **Responsiveness & Leadership Presence**
- **What this means:** Acknowledge quickly; communicate proactively; surface risks early. citeturn3search4
- **My actions:**
  - [ ] Set SLA for responses (≤ 30 mins ack during work hours).
  - [ ] Send crisp weekly exec updates (impact, metrics, risks, asks).

### 5) **Delegate “Average” Work; Elevate Value**
- **What this means:** Teach others; free time for high‑impact problems; short‑term pain, long‑term gain. citeturn3search4
- **My actions:**
  - [ ] Maintain a delegation board (task → owner → enablement → due).
  - [ ] Mentor at least 1–2 engineers into ownership.

### 6) **Profit & Sales Lens**
- **What this means:** Tie technical work to revenue enablement, cost reduction, retention, or risk mitigation. citeturn3search5
- **My actions:**
  - [ ] For each initiative, specify the business lever and metric.
  - [ ] Partner with PM/Finance to quantify impact where possible.

### 7) **Automate Regular Work; Build Systems & Processes**
- **What this means:** Reduce toil; increase team velocity; create durable assets. citeturn3search4
- **My actions:**
  - [ ] Identify top 3 toil areas and automate.
  - [ ] Publish and socialize standards (runbooks, design guides).

### 8) **Health & Sustainability**
- **What this means:** Protect weekends; escalate if health is at risk; sprint occasionally, not chronically. citeturn3search4
- **My actions:**
  - [ ] Set on‑call/after‑hours guardrails; review post‑mortems for preventable load.
  - [ ] Track load; address systemic causes (e.g., reliability work).
