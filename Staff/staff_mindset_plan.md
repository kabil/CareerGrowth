# 30-Day Staff Engineer Mindset Plan

> Purpose: Rewire thinking from output/effort to **customer & business outcomes**, develop **systems thinking**, and practice **influence without authority**.

---

## Week 1 — Foundations of Staff Mindset

### Read / Watch
- **Staff Engineer: Leadership Beyond the Management Track** (Will Larson), Ch. 1–4 — core expectations of Staff+ and how impact ≠ effort. citeturn3search1
- **Talk: “Being Glue”** (Tanya Reilly) — the invisible work that creates leverage across teams. citeturn3search4
- **Brian’s Notes: The Staff Engineer’s Path (summary)** — quick mental models: big‑picture, ambiguity, leveling others. citeturn3search5

### Reflection Prompts
- Where did I talk about effort instead of outcomes this week?
- What customer metric (SLA, latency, adoption, cost) did my work touch?

### Practice
- Rewrite one current task into an **outcome statement** (e.g., “reduce deploy time from 40m → 5m to enable daily releases”).

## Week 2 — Big‑Picture & Ambiguity

### Read / Watch
- **The Staff Engineer’s Path** (Tanya Reilly) — scope mapping, org navigation, influence without authority. citeturn3search2
- **Talk: “I Wouldn’t Start From Here”** (Tanya Reilly) — leading large technical change. citeturn3search4
- **StaffEng.com Resource Pack** — curated essays on technical decision‑making and behind‑the‑scenes leadership. citeturn3search4

### Reflection Prompts
- What ambiguous problem can I own and create clarity for?
- Which stakeholders do I need to align, and what would “done” look like for them?

### Practice
- Draft a **one‑page technical strategy** for a current area: context → problem → constraints → options → recommended path → measurable outcomes.

## Week 3 — Multiplying Others & Systems Thinking

### Read / Watch
- **Staff Engineer archetypes** (Tech Lead, Architect, Solver, Right Hand) to choose your operating mode. citeturn3search3
- **Essays: “Being Glue”, “Technical Decision Making”, “The Behind‑the‑Scenes Work of Tech Leadership”** — influence patterns and decision frameworks. citeturn3search4

### Reflection Prompts
- What recurring toil can be automated to free 30–40% team bandwidth?
- Whom can I coach to take over “average” tasks this month?

### Practice
- Create a **delegation plan** (task → target owner → enablement steps → success criteria).
- Identify one **systemic fix** (framework/tooling/process) that will outlast me and draft a proposal.

## Week 4 — Business Outcomes & Communication

### Read / Watch
- **Outcome‑first mindset** examples and summaries (connect work to revenue, cost, reliability, adoption). citeturn3search5
- **Additional Staff+ materials** (migrations, org side quests, sponsorship) to navigate political/people complexity. citeturn3search4

### Reflection Prompts
- How did my work contribute to **profit/sales**, or reduce **cost/risk** this week?
- Where did I demonstrate **responsiveness** and proactive communication?

### Practice
- Publish an **exec‑readable update** (≤ 5 bullets): customer impact, metrics moved, risks & asks.
- Finalize a **60‑90 day Staff Impact Plan** (initiatives, metrics, owners, milestones).

## Weekly Rituals (10–15 mins/day)
- **Morning:** clarify today’s *customer impact* in one sentence.
- **Mid‑day:** unblock someone; document a decision.
- **End of day:** capture outcome/metric; send a crisp status/ack.

## Metrics to Track (example set)
- Incident rate / MTTR; % of proactive detections. citeturn3search4
- Latency / error rate / availability vs. SLA. citeturn3search2
- Release frequency / lead time / change failure rate (DORA). citeturn3search4
- Infra cost per customer or per request. citeturn3search5
- Time saved via automation; onboarding time reduction. citeturn3search4
